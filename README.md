# h2n 

This public repository is a place holder for code for the Perl 5 program *h2n* awaiting copyright, licensing, and public use determination.  *h2n* is a Perl 5 utility program which is discussed in the book *DNS and BIND*, by Cricket Liu and Paul Albitz, and published by *O'Reilly Media, Inc.*

I queried the audience on reddit to see if anyone knew of the license status: Can anyone verify the license for the subject software program?

I got a message from Cricket Liu (on reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/dns/comments/4lp7v9/cricket_lius_perl_program_h2n/d3rwex6?context=3>) which said the program came from HP (with permission) and included a link to <ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/h2n/h2n.tar.gz>.  When going to the ftp site I found file <ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/h2n/h2n-2.61rc8> which does contain licensing info which is quoted here:

I have now incorporated that file into this repo.
